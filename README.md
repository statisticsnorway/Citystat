# Citystat
This repo contains code for tables requested by the Edamis City Project as well as code for automatization. 

The long-term objective is to make the Edamis City Project deliveries as atomized as possible.  

## Why is the repo public
The repo is public because we want to be able to receive suggestions on improvement, as well as inspiring pairs producing an API-driven production line in R.
