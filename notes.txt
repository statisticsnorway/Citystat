1. DE1_tables
    - intro to tables (demography, number of tables, data source, etc.)
    - Data import and processing with API
    
            --> Note about other data sources:
                    - Not every variable reported has Statbank as data source, either because it is incomplete or does not exist. 
                    - In these cases the data processing steps become much more tedious:
                        i) Reliant on communication across divisions and even departments,
                        ii) Datafiles require more manipulation and hence knowledge about the data. 
                    - In our experience, this can be very time consuming. 
                    - Detail on code for producing tables can be found in Github
    
    - Run script (emphasise how fast it is)

    - From output of all the tables that have been created and formatted correctly, select an example and present
        
2. Wrapping up: 
    - In building the production line we have explored many different ways of structuring our processes. 
    - In the current configuration, this is how we do it:
